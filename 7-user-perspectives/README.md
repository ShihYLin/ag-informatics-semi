# User Perspectives

First, we'll take a look at farmer perspectives on ag tech and data to understand what the current state + challenges are - you'll pick one of three articles depending on your interests. We'll all come back together to read one specific article that overviews trust issues. Then we'll dive into open source, since it's an oft-proposed solution to bridging the gap between farmers and their tech.

1. Learn about some farmer perspectives on ag-tech/data:
