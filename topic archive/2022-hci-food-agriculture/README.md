# Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in Food & Agriculture: Review Materials

Human-Computer Interaction is a discpline in which we consider the human experience of technology. We explore how and why people use technology to do work, design tools to accomodate the needs, capabilities, and desires of different types of users, and ultimately seek to improve the relationship between humans and technologies.

## Overview of the Topic
HCI is a field that arose when computers shifted from being rare and complex to being part of the household. Other specialized disciplines have branched off
of HCI, including HRI, HDI and ACI. The principles of these areas are being applied to problems in food and agriculture to good effect, though the future
of technolgies in agriculture and how the field will be transformed is still up for debate.

## Short Synopsis of Materials
1. HCI - brief intro
This article is a brief history and explanation of HCI. The concept of HCI began when personal computers were developed and
their use was spreading rapidly. HCI has had to change and adapt as computers became smaller, more portable, and integrated into other
objects such as cars. The concept originally focused on usability but has grown to include other qualities such as fun, flow and enhanced creativity.
It has also evolved from being part of the realm of computer science and reached many other departments such as psychology, design and cognitive science.
HCI can be represented bu the task-artifact cycle: "Human activities implicitly articulate needs, preferences and design visions. Artifacts are designed in response,
but inevitably do more than merely respond. Through the course of their adoption and appropriation, new designs provide new possibilities for action and interaction. 
Ultimately, this activity articulates further human needs, preferences, and design visions."

2. Human-Data Interaction
As computers evolved and users began to send more data out into the world, the concept of HDI developed. HDI involves the user generating data, the sharing and analysis
of that data by third parties, and the results of that data and the analyses being tied back to the user. "At the heart of HDI lies three core principles: legibility, agency and negotiability."
Legibility means that users are able to see and understand what is being done with their data: agency means the ability to interact with and manage our own data: and negotiability
means giving users the option to withdraw from data processing. 

3. Human-Robot interaction
"Human—Robot Interaction (HRI) is a field of study dedicated to understanding, designing, and evaluating robotic systems for use by or with humans"(Goodrich and Schultz, 2007, p. 204).
Evaluating a human-robot interaction can quickly become very complex, as there are many aspects of the robot's look and behavior that can be graded. There are many methods to evaluating
robot design without building multiple prototypes. This article includes a discussion of the roles robots can fill and the variety of designs they can have (e.g. humanoid and beyond). Ends with
a discussion of safety in human-robot interactions, separated in categories of physical and perceived.

4. Mobile Computing
"Mobile computing is a significant contributor to the pervasiveness of computing resources in modern western civilisation...Enabling us to orchestrate these devices to fit and serve our personal 
and working lives is a huge challenge for technology developers, and “as a consequence of pervasive computing, interaction design is poised to become one of the main liberal arts of the twenty-first 
century” (McCullough 2004)." This piece gives a look into the evolution of mobile devices as they became more portable and more powerful over the decades. A major part of moble computing design is
the context in which the device is to be used. 

5. Animal-Computer Interaction
A literature review from a variety of disciplines exploring "(a) how human-computer interaction (HCI) principles may apply (or not apply) to ACI, (b) how principles and 
computer system designs exclusive for ACI may be developed, and (c) how animal-centered computer designs may benefit HCI and
its user population." The paper starts out by explaining facets of HCI before moving into ACI. Examples of ACI were generally either a tablet,
a wearable or an owner-pet interaction system, and varied depending on animal physiology. Challenges spanned mechanisms, ethics and interfaces, and the paper
ended with a discussion of how HCI for disabled users can aid ACI and other areas.

6. Collaboration Technologies
"[of technologies of computer-supported cooperative work] We will describe their characteristics, in terms of what functions they serve, and we will mention some
of the studies done to evaluate them." A review of collaborative technologies: what their are, their history, and past research resulted explained.

7. Making Public Things: How HCI Design Can Express Matters of Concern
This paper analyzes 5 design projects to "explore some of the ways [HCI] design can function to express matters of concern." The paper defines
"matters of concern" as "contentious issues and their consequences." These projects combined data and design to present to users in an artistic way.
All involved user interaction, ranging from navigating through data to participating in a hackathon. These projects were broken down to show how
design for users can affect how well data is perceived and understood, and how this is important for issues affecting large swaths of the population.

8. A Grand Challenge for HCI: Food & Sustainability
A reflection on the collaboration of a group of researchers, designers and practitioners at the ACM CHI Conference of 2017, where the topic was
designing sustainable food systems. Half of the paper is dedicated to exploring the three major themes of the conversation: trust and accountability, food sovereignty,
and sustainable food policies. The other half discusses potential design pitfalls and the importance of the tenets of HCI, and lays out a research agenda designed 
to investigate the context in which sustainable agricultural design is taking place.

9. Ordinary User Experiences at Work: A Study of Greenhouse Growers
Focuses on the user experience of horticultural workers in greenhouses, specifically their experiences working with climate control systems.
The user experience (UX) was measured with a model called AttrakDiff. Part of the paper was dedicated to evaluating AttrakDiff (comparing it against a control questionnaire)
and part was dedicated to the analysis of the UX data. The UX was found to be ordinary, in the middle of the scale.

10. Digital Green: Participatory video for agricultural extension
Presentation of results of a trial of the research project Digital Green, which "seeks to disseminate targeted agricultural information to small and marginal
farmers in India using digital video." The trial looked at how effective Digital Green was at convincing these farmers to adopt new agricultural practices.

11. MIFresh: promoting local produce consumption
A layout of the design process of kiosks to promote the purchase of local produce and help the user make food choices by offering information and coupons.
The kiosks were placed in grocery stores and allowed the user to figure out a produce shopping plan right upon entry and offered recipes, a shopping list
function, and a rewards program.

12. Small Business Applications of Sourcemap: A Web Tool for Sustainable Design and Supply Chain Transparency
Sourcemap was originally designed for students of a particular course as "an introduction to the social and environmental issues associated with consumer products."
It was updated to become a tool for users to look up the carbon footprint of commodities they use in their work. The updated tool was tested by 5 entrepreneurs who
run sustainability-focused businesses. Researchers tracked how user behavior was affected by the tool and ued theur observations to improve the tool's design and 
add additional features.

13. Farm Robots: Ecological Utopia or Dystopia?
A discussion of where the future of agricultural robotics may be headed. It is argued that the difference between the utopia and dystopia is who is making
the decisions of robots and their use: for a utopia, all of society needs to have a say, and for a dystopia private entities will keep the decision making 
process one that will mainly consider the most beneficial path for themselves.

14. Safe Human-Robot Interaction in Agriculture
A survey of strawberry pickers who worked with field robots. The robots carted away crates of produce, and the workers were questioned on their view of robots
and how well the robot was able to work with them.

## Summary of Key Takeways from the Materials

1. *The future of HCI and agriculture hinges largely on policy and the players involved.* More and more technology is being developed for agricultural purposes,
but the future of agriculture depends on who is providing these tools, the kind of policies in places where the tools are being used, and, and the types of practices
new technologies uphold.

2. *HCI covers more areas than many people are aware of, and knowing these areas is important when designing new technology.* HCI covers the huge range of technologies
humans (or others!) can interact with, and every aspect of that interaction is tied back to HCI. Using a touchscreen kiosk is a part of HCI, but so is deciding where the
kiosk should physically be placed.

3. *Context is everything.* The basest principle of HCI, that no matter the technology, the who, what, when, where and why are the most important factors to consider. The
slightest variation in any use case can have large impacts on the user experience. The context of who is designing the tool and it what environment the work is happening
also has a big effect on the end product.


## Discussion Questions
1. Our week 1 discussion touched upon the idea of tool usefulness being of the utmost importance when thinking about designing for a user. After reading
through this week's materials, is there something to be said for creativity/fun being a part of the process?

2. One of my main takeaways was the success of technologies and the way the future agricultural tech landscape will look depends on who is designing and providing the technology,
and the kinds of policies put in place. Is this something anyone agrees/disagrees with? Does anyone think there are other factors that will have a greater impact?

3. Has anyone had to implement HCI priciples into their work before? Has anyone implemented HCI principles without recognizing them as HCI?

4. Could everyone share which papers they read from the "choose your own" list, and offer a short summary and some thoughts?

## Discussion Notes and Feedback
Discussion Topics:

Human-Data Interaction
-The article inspired a call to action and more thought about online data protections
-It was interesting that HCI/HDI principles can contradict each other

Mobile Computing
-Good ideas can go bac depending on how it is implemented and who implements it

Safe Human-Robot Interaction
-Bias towards more experienced workers vs. intentially designing a study around them

Do "problem solutions" actually solve the problems they're addressing?
-Other inequalities get exacerbated
-Some papers that claim to have considered social/environmental factors add these sections as an afterthought
-Sometimes technology is offered up to solve a problem without considering that the problem is a symptom of a larger wrong
-In terms of ag tech research, practices that check if farming are actually using/needing these technologies should be implemented, especially
if the project is getting state/federal funding

Important things for creators to consider
-Software creators should not interact with user testing, as they may inadvertently affect user experience
-Ag tech creators without an ag background should learn the science and procedures of the field they're designing for

End of Discussion Takeaways
-Design of HCI and HDI influences usability of any tool and influences how much a user takes in data
-There is a disconnect between those enacting policy and those being affected by it

Related tangent
-After discussing HCI and ACI, is there a space for PCI (plant-computer interaction)?
