# Communicating Data

Given that each of you are engaged in research, you are likely going to need to communicate data through data visualizations. These visualizations may consist of graphs, text, diagrams, and other components. You may combine these into posters, dashaboards or other types of user interfaces. Instead of trying to squeeze in UI design, we will just focus on data visualization this week, since it is a critical component of communicating data. 

So, this week, I want you to take some time to think about how you can communicate data **your research + data** to different audiences through data visualizations. Even if you haven't started data collection, all of you have at least topical areas that you are interested in, so consider, at minimum, the types of data you might need to visualize in your work.

1. Watch this very short (~8min) video that introduces concepts of data visualization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdSZJzb-aX8

2. Watch this in-depth webinar (~1hour) on "Introduction to Data Visualization"

3. Read this brief style guide + case study on data visualizations in the domain of climate change communication: https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2021-04/apo-nid314650.pdf I share this as an example of how you might operationalize some of the things you learn about data visualization through the materials of this week. It looks longer than it is, pages 3-13 contain the core content, and it's very nicely laid out so don't anticipate densely packed text :)

4. A very short (~7 mins) video to give you an overview of web design: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iVVM_DgWY4. Though we do not go into this topic, I thought this video did a neat job at explaining how different forms of web design fit together. This should suffice to close us out this week.

# SUBMISSION

Instead of a topic analysis, this week, I ask you to provide **1 page** overview of the different ways in which **you** will need to communicate data as part of your research. You will submit this on Brightspace. Here's the questions I want you to answer:

	1) What types of data or information do you need to communicate in your work? Are there particular types of insights that you are trying to glean or communicate through visualizations?

	2) Consider this data viz catalogue: https://datavizcatalogue.com/ Given the types of data that you are working with, which of these data visualizations do you think will be most productive in communicating your work? Give us a sense of how you might use different visualizations for different types of data from your work.

	3) What are your main challenges when it comes to visualizing and communicating your research and data?

	4) If you know, what tools might you use to build your data visualizations? What resources are you looking for?

	5) Questions: A list of 3-5 questions for the in-class discussion.

## Overview of the Topic
Data is generated daily in different aspect of research, experiment and studies. These datasets can be overwhelming due to their size, complexity or method of collection. Data is an embodiment of information which have to be processed and presented in a meaningful way to illustrate particular ideas, trends or patterns to a reader or audience. The big question then becomes, how do we communicate data to the audience to make sense and review the truth? Communicating data to a reader or audience is a way of reviewing information from a dataset by utilizing some tools to create a graphical image. This graphical image is called data visualization which provides a unique way to communicate data. Data visualization is a graphical representation of information and data. It is also the representation of large amount of disparate information in a visual form that often allows you to see patterns/trends, that would otherwise be buried in vast, unconnected datasets. Data visualization come in different forms such as graphs — line, scatterplot; charts — bar, heat maps, animation and so on. The purpose or goal of data visualization is majorly for insight and understanding about a subject or research. The choice of data visualization form plays a major role in establishing the type of information or awareness you want to establish. Hence you need to know your readers or audience and, in some cases, understand their level of graphical literacy. Data visualization should be made easy to understand, simple text and good color contrasts and combinations. 
 

## Short Synopsis of Materials
1.	Introducing concepts of data visualization: Data visualization may vary from low — for example a ling graph, to high level — for example google map. Data itself is a result of research and its just a clue to the end truth. Data visualization process can begin by first digging deep into the data itself and finding out key points. Secondly, creating a hierarchy of key points and thirdly, manage the different pieces of information which will help you learn what the data is saying and have a clear narrative. In the design of data visualization process, three things should inform your design process. First, you as the designer — that is what you have to say and what you want to communicate. Second, the reader — the reader may come with his own biases and assumptions and you need to account for such in your data visualization. Third, the data itself — what it has to say and how that informs the truth. 
2.	Introduction to data visualization: Data visualization allows you to understand and process enormous amounts of information quickly because it is all represented in a single image or animation. The human brain processes visuals/images faster. Data visualization helps to unlock hidden trends or truths for better insight of the data. This insight leads to discovery, decision making, analysis of data, and explanation. Data visualization is important and its utilization cuts across different fields. For example, bio-visualization shows visualization of biological data, often grouped with computer animation; information visualization shows interdisciplinary study of the visual representation of large-scale collections of non-numerical information such as survey data; geographic visualization communicates geospatial information which allows data exploration and decision making process; scientific visualization mostly emphases on realistic rendering of volumes, surface, illumination and so on. Data visualization process loops around data acquisition, parse, filtering, mine (using statistics), visual representation, refine and interaction. There are a number of data visualization tools such as Microsoft Excel, Gephi, Tableau, PowerBi, ARC GIS, D3.j3, Paraview, survey of security visualization and so on. 
3.	Data visualizations in the domain of climate change communication: Data communication for climatic conditions can be challenging due to the multifaceted nature of climate concepts, it is often difficult to simplify a desired message into a visual form that is suitable for public understanding. This material provides some data visualization guidelines and what you should take note of. First, message —the information you are trying to pass across to the reader must be clear. Second, layout — the choice of the visualization form is vital, and keep it simple, logical and consistent. Third, Language — use simple and plain sentences without idioms/figurative language. Fourth color — avoid yellow background or non-focus aspects, avoid very bright and very dim colors, use contrasting colors to signify and differentiate categories. Fifth, implementation — consider if your graph is easily perceived and understood. Sixth impact — test and iterate graphs and get feedbacks from people, understand what the visualization is saying and also ensure it is attention grabbing.
4.	 Overview of web design: In web design, a lot of visualization is carried out to ensure the user interface is easy to navigate and provides the necessary information the user needs. The importance of color in web designing is very vital. In designing, consideration should be made for color used for print design vs color for screen display. Also, users research is key in web designing. Target audience should be priority in web designing. 
5.	Science of visual data communication - What works: Visualizing and communicating data may vary across different fields, however the goal is to ensure the message and information can easily be communicated to your reader or audience. An effectively designed visualizations can cause confusion or even distrust especially among viewers with minimal graphical literacy.
6.	Introduction to data visualization and spreadsheet-based data: Data used for visualization can be grouped into the following; temporal, survey, computational, community based, social media, and archival. The collaboration and utilization of the data type, tools and the types of data visualization yields data visualization. 


## Summary of Key Takeways from the Materials
	If you want to change someone’s mind/perspective, then data visualization is a good way. 
	Data visualization is a good way of compressing huge dataset into a piece to view hidden details.
	Data visualization should be tailored to the reader and audience.
	Size of datasets and target audience may influence the level of data visualization.

## Discussion Notes and Feedback
•	Data with table is also a form of data visualization.
•	Data visualization can easily pull huge datasets into a single image with losing the vital information about the datasets. 
•	Often times, the initial data visualization type created is mostly due to what we want instead of prioritizing the reader or audience that will be engaged in the visualization. 
•	Data visualization feedbacks from people can help improve the overall quality and information of the data visualization form. 
•	Animation is a high-level form of data visualization which is attention grabbing. 
•	The most common form of data visualization used among students in class are bar charts, line/scatter graphs, tables and maps (from ARC GIS). 
•	Pie chart visualization is sometimes under-utilized. 
•	Common data visualization tools used are Excel, Tableau, Python, ARC-GIS and R.
•	As a reader or audience, moving data inform of animation may pose a challenge in following, navigating and understanding information/trends especially when the reader or audience has no control over the data that is visualized.  
•	Data visualization provides insight and helps the process of decision making and further analysis.
