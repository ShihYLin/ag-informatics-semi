# Digital Agriculture: Software Show & Tell

Come to class prepared to show us a piece of software that you think of as an example of a digital agricultural tool. 

You will share your screen (or if it's a mobile app you're welcome to just take screenshots for us and stick them in miro/slides), and show us a 2 minute demo of how it's used. 

This week, please each person should create provide **1-2 page** overview of the tool. You will submit this on Brightspace. Here's the questions I want you to answer:

	1) About the Tool: What does it do? When was it built? Who built it and why? 

	2) Utility: How useful is it for users (farmers, managers, workers, etc)?

	3) Usability: How easy is it to use?

	4) Interoperability: can we move data across tools, devices, systems? 

	5) Trust: what data is being collected and how is it being used/retained? 

	6) Resilient: do you think this is a robust, reliable, or adaptable tool? Will it stand / has it stood the test of time?

	7) Why is this a good piece of software?

	8) What are some issues with it?

	9) How would you make it better?
