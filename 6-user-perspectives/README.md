# User Perspectives

First, we'll take a look at farmer perspectives on ag tech and data to understand what the current state + challenges are - you'll pick one of three articles depending on your interests. We'll all come back together to read one specific article that overviews trust issues. Then we'll dive into open source, since it's an oft-proposed solution to bridging the gap between farmers and their tech.

1. Learn about some farmer perspectives on ag-tech/data:
PICK ONE. Make a list of 5 interesting things that you learned:

# FYI: Creating a Pull Request

*IMPORTANT:*

Before beginning your work ensure that you first create a "fork" from the course GitHub page. This creates a copy of the ag-informatics-seminar course content onto *your* GitHub repository. From this point you should git clone this repository onto your device and proceed by making edits to the desired file in that location. Below are three YouTube videos that I found helpful when learning how to create a pull request, additionally I also encountered some issues when using Terminal git commands and was able to fairly easily find solutions on stackoverflow.com . Let me know if you have any additional questions!
