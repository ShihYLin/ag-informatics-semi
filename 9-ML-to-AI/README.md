# From ML to AI

Here's the main video for this week: https://www.wired.com/video/watch/machine-learning-living-in-the-age-of-ai-film

I'd like to supplement this with two things:

1. In this 15 min video, Genevieve Bell (who also features in the main video) talks about 6 ethical questions about AI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGHzKaAOOcA. This is an incredibly important set of reminders as we think about the future of technology.

2. This Atlantic article discusses the juxtaposition between "wizards" and "prophets", talking in terms of techno-optimism and techno-skepticism too: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/03/charles-mann-can-planet-earth-feed-10-billion-people/550928/ Given the very optimistic outlook of the Wired article, I thought it important to share this perspective too.
