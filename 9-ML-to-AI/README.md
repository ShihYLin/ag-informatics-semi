# From ML to AI

Here's the main video for this week: https://www.wired.com/video/watch/machine-learning-living-in-the-age-of-ai-film

I'd like to supplement this with two things:

1. In this 15 min video, Genevieve Bell (who also features in the main video) talks about 6 ethical questions about AI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGHzKaAOOcA. This is an incredibly important set of reminders as we think about the future of technology.

2. This Atlantic article discusses the juxtaposition between "wizards" and "prophets", talking in terms of techno-optimism and techno-skepticism too: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/03/charles-mann-can-planet-earth-feed-10-billion-people/550928/ Given the very optimistic outlook of the Wired article, I thought it important to share this perspective too.

# SUBMISSION

Your topic analysis this week is in two parts (2 pages max). The first half is related to this topic DSTs, the second, related to the ML to AI topic. You'll see this exact same text in both topics.

I want you to think about your own research in two ways, first, with respect to short term decision support, and second, with respect to longer term ML/AI applications.

1. Empowering users to make decisions: We've read a couple of papers that focus on the human-centered design of decision support tools. In the context of your work:
	- What are 3 knowledge-intensive decisions faced by people in your work?
	- What types of decision support tools, if any, are people already using?
	- What decision support tools do you think might be *actually useful* to the stakeholders of your work?

2. Imagining the future of ag tech: We watched a fairly techno-optimistic vision of the potential of machine learning in our current society. In the context of your work:
	- What is ONE challenge that may be solved/supported through ML solutions? Who are the main beneficiaries of this work? Are there any potential inequalities ML may create?
	- What are some of the challenges you may face in developing ML in your work?
	- How might you define "real" Artificial Intelligence in your work, or a "General Purpose" AI?

## Overview of the Topic
 
To tackle the increasing challenges of agricultural production in terms of productivity, environmental impacts, and sustainability, the complex agricultural systems need to be continuously monitored using modern technologies, such as in-field and remote sensors. These sensors generate a large amount of heterogeneous data at an unprecedented rate. These large quantities of data cannot be processed by the traditional data analysis methods and require special methods to extract something meaningful that can help the farmer to make well-informed decisions. Since the machine learning techniques are flexible and capable of processing massive volumes of data, therefore, their applications can be widely seen in agriculture. The upcoming sections will provide some sense of how machine learning and artificial intelligence have revolutionized the world and helped humans make more informed decisions and will also highlight the challenges that current state-of-art machine learning models face, especially in terms of scalability. Additionally, it will help you to broaden your mind and think about some critical questions before you deploy machine learning in your domain.

## Short Synopsis of Materials
1. Machine learning: Living in the age of AI film
	The film "Machine learning: Living in the Age of AI" depicts how different people of varying ages interact with artificial intelligence (AI) and how AI has made their lives easy, either it is for old men who use Alexa to listen music and use virtual reality to play games or people who travel in a self-driving car or how AI helped you to track your health, sort your photographs or predict text while writing emails. The film's tone is full of positivity toward AI, starting from the beginning when the 70-year-old man says, "the evolution of technology is inevitable and benefits mankind." To further support it, they introduce a young entrepreneur who is developing technologies to detect pancreatic cancer at its earliest stage or predicting the chance of skin cancer using images. They further provide insights into the building blocks of artificial intelligence, neural network, and how they train with the data. The video further addresses the issues related to data security and scalability.

2. 6 big ethical questions about the future of AI
	"AI is everywhere around us and in many places, it's in building and in systems" -- *Genevieve Bell*
		The video mainly focuses on *Cybernetics*, which means studying and developing a technique/approach that will enable us to indeed attack the problem of control and communication in advanced computing technologies and think about humans, computers, and the broader ecological world. The story of mechanization, automation, and digitalization shows the importance of technology and shows how scaling the algorithm, system, or software is normal, expected, and predictable. But in reality, scaling the technology or building the system is a lot more. In my opinion, scaling the technology or software or system is even harder when it comes to the agricultural domain, because of many reasons, such as different environmental constraints, like variation in temperature, rain, humidity, radiation intensity; variation in soil properties and types, different farming and management practices, and other social and economic factors. For example, some vegetative index, such as excess green segmentation, can provide satisfactory results in one application but might not be good in other applications [2]. Therefore, while developing systems, we must try to think of six major questions, which are:

		1. *Autonomy*: Is their system autonomous?
		2. *Agency*: Does your system has any agency, that controls and limits to do certain kind of things under certain conditions?
		3. *Assurance*: How you assure the users about the following pieces, such as: safety, security, trust, liability, manageability, ethics, public policy, law and regulations?
		4. *Interface*: What would be your interface with these AI-driven systems? Will they be talking to themselves or with the users and how?
		5. *Indicators*: What are the indicators that shows your softwore is working well and doing what it is supposed to do?
		6. *Intent*: What is the world that this system is creating? What is the relationship of your software or system with the world we live in today?
	The last quote that I really like and motivates me to go with interdisciplinary collaboration is: "That it is never just a hero's journey, its always a collection of people who have a shared sense of purpose who can change the world.."

3. Can planet Earth feed 10 billion people?
	This article mainly debates the two kinds of ideology, one which cares more about the environment and believes that humankind should drastically reduce consumption and limit populations, the Prophets, and the other who are more bent on technology, the Wizards, who thinks if technology properly applied, will let us produce enough that we require. The article further supported both the approaches by providing different instances, such as how the green revolution increased the yield, the Wizard's view, and how the green revolution has harmed the soil by the excessive use of fertilizers, the Prophets approach. Furthermore, in the end, the article talks about the right way to live according to both approaches. As per the Prophet's approach, one should take care of soil first and try to grow multiple crops in patches; bring back some people to the countryside, rather than all living in cities; and provide workers with a decent living. In contrast, as per the Wizard's approach, the right way of living is to consolidate and mechanize the farms to increase harvest and reduce cost; earn more by growing more; and benefit the nation by increasing the exports. In my view, there should be a balance between both approaches, and I guess that was sustainability in agriculture is all about, which targets to grow enough food to meet the needs without compromising with the ecosystem.

## Summary of Key Takeways from the Materials
1. AI is a powerful tool that can revolutionize the world and can make our life better.
2. While building a software or a system think about the bigger picture, how it can be transfered to scale, how it will interact with the users and systems. 
3. Data security and privacy is highly important, so try to think about how you as the developer can ensure data security and privacy.


## Discussion Questions
Q1. How do you feel after reading the recent articles in your domain, when it comes to ML or AI? Was it really required to deploy ML or their were any other simpler alternatives that can be used to solve that problem?
Q2. Does the author discusses the results and materials and methods in-depth by providing enough details and background or they just use ML as a tool?
Q3. What are the main challenges that stops you or sometimes motivates you to use ML in your domain?
Q4. How as a developer you envision you can contribute in your domain by using AI as a tool?
Q5. Among the Prophets and Wizards approach, which one do you support and why?
